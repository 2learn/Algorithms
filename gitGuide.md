## GitGuide
Want to submit a pull request to this repo but a little unsure how to do it? Don't worry. We've got you covered with our GitGuide!

Step 1
Fork the repo
![first](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/first.png?raw=true)

Step 2
Navigate back to your personal repo and copy the clone link from your fork.  
![clone](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/clone.png?raw=true)

Step 3
From the command line make a local clone with that copied link.
![clone2](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/clone2.png?raw=true)

Step 4
`cd` into the repo, make a new branch, and start writing some code
![branch](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/branch.png?raw=true)

`atom .` is a shortcut I use to open my text editor, you might use `subl` to open sublime or some other way of opening the repository.

Step 5
When you've added your problems and solutions and are ready to share them, add, commit, and push your changes
![commit](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/commit.png?raw=true)

Step 6
On github, make a pull request to WomenWhoCodeNYC
When you've added your problems and solutions and are ready to share them, add, commit, and push your changes
![pullRequest](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/pullRequest.png?raw=true)

![pullRequest2](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/pullRequest2.png?raw=true)

Step 7
Wait a few days for some feedback. We may make suggestions on how to improve your code or how to submit things so that they match our current style guides. If so you'll see the feedback on your public pullrequest on the WomenWhoCodeNYC Algorithm's repo. Or we might choose to merge it as is!

Step 8
Pat yourself on the back and tell a friend how cool that was. Let them know they should submit something too!

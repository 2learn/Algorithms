## Problem 2 - Balanced Parentheses
Problem found on [StackExchange](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/45916/check-for-balanced-parentheses)

Given a string, determine if the Parentheses, Braces, and Brackets are properly balanced.

For example, the program should print true for
```
exp = "[()]{}{[()()]()}"
```
and false for
```
exp = "[(])"
```

**Problem 3**  <br>
Design a stack that support the normal stack operations( `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`, and `isEmpty()` ) but also has a function called `getMin()` which returns the value of the minimum element in the stack. All functions should run in constant ( (O(1) ) time.

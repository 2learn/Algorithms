## Find the 2 largest element in BST(binary search tree):

Write a function to find the 2nd largest element in a binary search tree:

*A binary search tree is a binary tree in which, for each node:

* The node's value is greater than all values in the left subtree.
* The node's value is less than all values in the right subtree.
BSTs are useful for quick lookups. If the tree is balanced, we can search for a given value in the tree in O(lgn) time.*

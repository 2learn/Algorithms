Given a number n, generate all distinct ways to write n as the sum of positive integers. For example, with n = 4, the options are 4, 3 + 1, 2 + 2, 2 + 1 + 1, and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. (Note that 3+1 and 1+3 are considered the same and thus only 3+1 is a part of the result).

You can output your results as an array of strings (["4","3+4", "2+2", "2+1+1", "1+1+1+1"]).

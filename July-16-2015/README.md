These are technical interview practice problems meant to be done on a white board or piece of paper. This particular set of questions is meant for the Women Who Code NYC Algorithms meetup on July 16, 2015.

Note that the problems are ordered from least difficult (Problem 1) to most difficult (Problems 5 and 6). Problems can be done in any programming language although solutions have been written in Javascript and/or pseudocode. Feel free to make a pull request with alternate solutions or solutions in other languages and share your solutions!

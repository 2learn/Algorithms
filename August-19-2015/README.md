# Got a Solution?
Follow these steps to contribute your favorite solution in whatever language you love:
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally
2. Create a branch for your solution
3. Add and commit your changes (make sure it works! Bonus points for solutions with their own tests!)
4. Push that branch to your clone on github
5. Make a pull request with that solution
6. Let one of the volunteers know that you made a PR and one of us will review it as soon as we can!

# New to git?
Git and Github allow us to collaborate on projects without ever worrying about losing our work. Think google docs but with version control and for code.

To get started here's a few free tutorials/readings:
* [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
* [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
* [Git Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [Git for Beginners](http://www.sitepoint.com/git-for-beginners/)
* [StackOverFlow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide)

And of course feel free to ask your peers and the volunteers for help!

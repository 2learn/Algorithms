#Contribute to the WWCNYC Algorithms group!

## Things we LOVE:
* `Free resources!` They go in our [main readme](./README.md)
* `New problems!` They should be language agnostic, vary widely in difficulty, and should take between 2-30 minutes to complete. We aim to have about 6 problems per event, with level 1 being the easiest and level 6 being the hardest. If you submit a problem, please consider submitting one solution as well in either pseudo code or the language of your choice.
* `New solutions!` We accept all levels of optimization and all languages. Consider adding tests for bonus points :)
* `Presenters!` Do you have a 3-10 minute talk that could help someone ace their next interview or come one step closer to mastering algorithms? Talk to one of our volunteers and pitch us your idea.
* `Tutors` and `in person volunteers!` We need folks to do everything from help people check in, to find the bathroom, to tutor beginners, to push our advanced folks farther. If one of those roles sounds exciting to you, talk to a volunteer!

## Got a good `problem`? Maybe a sweet `solution`?
Follow these steps to contribute your favorite solution in whatever language you love:
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally
2. Create a branch
3. Add and commit your changes.
4. Push that branch to your clone on github
5. Make a pull request with your branch to the WWC branch
6. Let one of the volunteers know that you made a PR and one of us will review it as soon as we can!

## New to git?
Git and Github allow us to collaborate on projects without ever worrying about losing our work (or our minds). Think google docs but with better version control.

To get started here are a few free tutorials/readings:
* [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
* [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
* [Git Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [Git for Beginners](http://www.sitepoint.com/git-for-beginners/)
* [StackOverFlow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide)

And of course feel free to ask your peers and the volunteers for help!

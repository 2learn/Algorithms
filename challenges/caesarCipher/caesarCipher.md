Create a [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

With a Caesar Cipher you are giving a key (say the number 3) and all of the letters of the alphabet rotate that many number of spaces over. Can you create a function that can encrypt/decrypt a message using the ceasar cipher?

Extreme bonus points for creating a decrypter than can decrypt caesar's cipher without a key.

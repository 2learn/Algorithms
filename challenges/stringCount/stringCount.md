Given a string and a non-empty substring, compute recursively the number of times that substring appears in the string, without the sub strings overlapping.

strCount("catcowcat", "cat") → 2
strCount("catcowcat", "cow") → 1
strCount("catcowcat", "dog") → 0


Can you solve this iteratively and recursively?

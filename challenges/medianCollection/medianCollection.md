Implement a class that calculates the median number in a group of numbers, allows you to add
new numbers to a collection and can compute the median.

e.g.
class MedianCollection
  def add_number(number)
    // add nubmer to your collection
  end

  def median
   // return median
  end
end

What data structures you could use to store the numbers?
How would your median calculation differ with each data structure?

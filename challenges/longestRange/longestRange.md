**Level 4**  <br>
Write a function that accepts as input an array of integers and then returns the length of the longest consecutive range of integers that appear somewhere in that array. For example, [16, 6, 12, 5, 4, 10, 2, 11, 13, 3, 15], it should return 5 (2,3,4,5,6 are all in the array so the longest range of consecutive numbers is 5). What if you wanted to actually return the numbers in the longest range (for example, for this example, you would return [2,3,4,5,6]). Analyze the time and space efficiency of your algorithm.

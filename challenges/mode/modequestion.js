// Given a set of numbers, how could you find the mode? 

// A mode is a value that appears most often in a set of data.

// Create a function SimpleMode(arr). Let it take the array of numbers stored in arr and return the number that appears most frequently (the mode).

  // code goes here  
  return mode;

## Balanced Parentheses
Problem found on [StackExchange](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/45916/check-for-balanced-parentheses)

Given an expression string exp, write a program to examine whether the pairs and the orders of
```
"{","}","(",")","[","]"
```
are correct in exp.

For example, the program should print true for
```
exp = "[()]{}{[()()]()}"
```
and false for
```
exp = "[(])"
```

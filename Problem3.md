## Interconvert strings and integers

A string is a sequence of characters. 
A string may encode an integer, e.g., "-987" encodes 987.
Implement methods that take a string representing an integer 
and return the corresponding integer, and vice versa.
Your code should handle negative integers. 
You cannot use library fucntions like stoi in C++ and parseInt in Java.

Imagine after your first pay check from your first job as an amazing lady programmer, you invested a portion of it into some stock market shares. Now imagine that a few years later you want to see how much those shares are worth but for some bizarre reason you wanted to figure it out yourself with a list of days and the percentage change of the value of those share. How could you go about it?

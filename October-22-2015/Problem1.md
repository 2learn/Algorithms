## Egg boiler
Problem originally found on [codewars](http://www.codewars.com/)

Imagine you run a restaurant, where the main specialty is a boiled egg. Your particular pot/stove set up allows you to boil up to 8 eggs every 5 minutes. If all of the attendees from tonight's meet up went to your restaurant at once after some awesome algorithm-ing, how could you determine how long it would take before the last person got their egg?

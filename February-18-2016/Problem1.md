Create a [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

With a Caesar Cipher you are giving a key (say the number 3) and all of the letters of the alphabet rotate that many number of spaces over. Create two functions that use the Caesar cipher, an encrypter and decrypter.

Bonus points for creating a decrypter than can decrypt caesar's cipher without a key.
